    "1. **Setup & Configuration**: Load libraries, set random seed, define paths  \n",
    "2. **Data Loading & Inspection**: Read in data, inspect shape and basic summaries  \n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, type conversions  \n",
    "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze target distribution and key features  \n",
    "5. **Feature Engineering**: Create and transform useful input features  \n",
    "6. **Modeling â€” Baseline**: Train a Logistic Regression model  \n",
    "7. **Evaluation**: Compute ROCâ€‘AUC, confusion matrix, precision/recall  \n",
    "8. **Results & Insights**: Summarize key findings and model behavior  \n",
    "9. **Conclusion & Next Steps**: Reflect on outcomes and outline enhancements  \n",
